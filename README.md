Project by Varun Mangla, Jackson Lagerway, Abdullah Naveed, Wesley Tu, and Andrew Katchour.

A Chatbot Assistant geared around assisting users with navigating the Benson menu at SCU and determining the best meals for their needs.

The voiceflow-discord folder is comprised of code that we borrowed from online and used for testing purposes; we made some changes to try to get it to work with threads and our original replit, but, as it is right now, our discord implementation is not complete.

Additionally, voiceflow + replit + assistant API integration utilizes following template to facilitate the connections: https://replit.com/@bogdansaranchuk/custom-gpts-to-website-template?v=1#main.py . Majority of the code behind our bot is seen in the natural language used to provide instructions for our bot due to the nature of the Assistant API tool we used.
